# PhishMaestro
A tool to take control of the requests that come into your phishing site and send different payloads to different users. You select the payloads in real-time based on whatever parameters of the HTTP request you wish to take into account.

Defaults parameters are:
- Username
- Password
- HTTP User-Agent
- Remote IP Address (and OrgName from whois)

Add whatever variables you wish to track, and automate it!
